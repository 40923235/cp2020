Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including:Learning Objectives: These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable your progress a you to monitor s you explore the content and engage in the activities.Explanatory Content: This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:Walk-throughs: These are videos embedded in the pages to exemplify the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process.Examples: Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve.Labs: Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements.Many Students Wonder sidebars: These sidebars serve two purposes: \n (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and \n (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz. \n 本課程包含多個模板。每個模板均具有旨在支持你作為獨立學習者的功能，包括:學習目標：這些是描述本節最後應該做的事情。學習目標將指導你能夠努力學習，並監控探索內容和參與活動的進度。解釋內容：這是每章的信息性“內容”。由簡短的段落，信息，示例，圖像和說明組成，此說明性內容包含以下內容：演練：這些是嵌入在頁面中的視頻，以例證你所探索的概念。他們可能會提供有關主題的更詳細說明，或指導你完成流程的每個步驟。範例：說明該課程支持你實現的技能和學習目標的應用。實驗室：模擬和實驗室活動旨在為您提供與各種硬件元素進行交互的機會。許多學生都想知道側邊欄：這些側邊欄有兩個目的： \n （1）快速回顧概念，例如PC硬件材料中使用的“高度專業化的輸入設備” \n （2）提供其他材料或背景信息您可能會發現令人驚訝和有趣的東西，但是測驗中不會對此進行評估。 \n \n \n Learning Activities: There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:Learn By Doing activities: Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.Did I Get This? activities: Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities.Quizzes: These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz.Metacognitive Activities: These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:My Response activities: These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you\'ve attained the module\'s learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you\'re using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor). \n 學習活動：整個課程中擁有著不同類型的活動。它們包括：邊做邊學的活動：邊做邊學的活動遵循簡短的說明和示例。這些活動使你有機會研究和實踐關鍵思想。邊做邊學活動有提示和反饋，以在需要時指導你。我明白了嗎？活動：我明白了嗎？活動是你進行快速進行“自我檢查”的機會。這些活動沒有提示，通常會跟著“邊做邊學”的活動，以便你確定自己是否了解關鍵思想。這將幫助你確保已準備好進行分級活動。測驗：這些是評分的短期作業。每個模板的末端都有一個測驗。測驗將向你和你的老師展示你對關鍵概念的理解程度。如果你閱讀了該信息並在每個模板中進行了活動，那麼你應該已經做好準備。認知活動：這些活動旨在支持你成為獨立學習者的發展，鼓勵你反思自己的進步併計劃繼續取得成功。這些活動包括：我的反應活動：這些簡短的活動位於模板的末端；他們鼓勵你反思本單元的學習進度，並估計你認為自己達到本單元學習目標的程度。這些活動還提供了一個分享繼續存在的問題和困難領域的地方（如果你與講師一起使用本課程，你的問題將與講師分享）。 \n Checkpoints: These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive checkpointsencourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you\'re not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials. \n 檢查點：這些活動位於課程的各個部分之後，這些部分可能特別具有挑戰性或需要其他練習。這些元認知 檢查點可以 鼓勵你回顧至今為止的進展並進行自我評估：你準備好繼續嗎?還是你認為你需要其他材料，練習或自我評估？如果你感覺還沒有準備好繼續，可以使用這些檢查點來鏈接到其他學習資料。 \n About these Materials 關於這些材料 \n ©2016 \xa0 Cyber Pathways Across Maryland . \n Unless otherwise specified, CPAM materials are licensed under a \xa0 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . \n This workforce solution was funded by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration.

If you think about what steps you need to take to complete the assignment and determine when it is reasonable to begin, you are exercising skill #3 by planning. If you start in on your plan and realize that you are working more slowly than you anticipated, you are putting skill #4 to work by applying a strategy and monitoring your performance. Finally, if you reflect on your performance in relation to your time frame for the task, and discover an equally effective but more efficient way to work, you are engaged in skill #5 of reflecting and adjusting your approach as needed. \n \n \n \n \n \n 你得到一個作業並問自己： \n “這項作業確切涉及什麼，我在本課程中從中學到了什麼？” \n 你正在通過評估任務並評估與之相關的優缺點來鍛煉第一和第二元認知技能。如果你考慮需要採取什麼步驟來完成作業並確定何時開始合理的訓練，那麼你正在通過計劃來鍛煉技能3。如果你按計劃開始工作，並且意識到自己的工作速度比預期的要慢，那麼你將通過應用策略和監控績效來使技能4發揮作用。最後，如果你根據任務的時間框架來反思自己的績效，並且發現一種同樣有效但更有效的工作方式，那麼你將掌握技巧五，根據需要反思和調整方法。 \n Metacognition is not rocket science. In some respects, it is fairly ordinary and intuitive. Yet you’d be surprised how often people lack strong metacognitive skills, and you’d be amazed by how much weak metacognitive skills can undermine performance.
