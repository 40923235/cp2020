These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities. \n Quizzes: \xa0 These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz. \n \n \n Metacognitive Activities: \xa0 These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success.
