<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learning Objectives:</em></em><span> </span>These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable your progress a you to monitor s you explore the content and engage in the activities.</li>
<li><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang=""><span><span>學習目標：</span></span></em></em><span><span>這些是描述本節末尾應該做的事情。</span><span>學習目標將指導你能夠努力學習，並監控探索內容和參與活動的進度。</span></span></li>
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Explanatory Content:</em></em><span> </span>This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:</li>

<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Many Students Wonder sidebars:</em><span> </span>These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang=""><span><span>許多學生都想知道側邊欄：</span></span></em><span><span>這些側邊欄有兩個目的：（1）快速回顧概念，例如PC硬件材料中使用的“高度專業化的輸入設備”，以及（2）提供其他材料或背景信息您可能會發現令人驚訝和有趣的東西，但是測驗中不會對此進行評估。</span></span></li>

<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learning Activities:</em></em><span> </span>There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learn By Doing activities:</em><span> </span>Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Did I Get This? activities:</em><span> </span>Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Quizzes:</em><span> </span>These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Metacognitive Activities:</em></em><span> </span>These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">My Response activities:</em><span> </span>These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you've attained the module's learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you're using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor).</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Checkpoints:</em><span> </span>These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive<span> </span><span class="term" lang="">checkpoints</span>encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you're not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials.</li>

<h2>Develop</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> 的開發, 可以在一個目錄中放入 cmsimde, 然後將 up_dir 中的內容放到與 cmsimde 目錄同位階的地方, 使用 command 進入 cmsimde 目錄, 執行 python wsgi.py, 就可以啟動, 以瀏覽器 https://localhost:9443 就可以連接, 以 admin 作為管理者密碼, 就可以登入維護內容.</p>
<p>cmsimde 的開發採用 Leo Editor, 開啟 cmsimde 目錄中的 cmsimde.leo 就可以進行程式修改, 結束後, 若要保留網際內容, 只要將 cmsimde 外部的內容倒回 up_dir 目錄中即可後續對 cmsimde 遠端倉儲進行改版.</p>
<p>init.py 位於  up_dir 目錄, 可以設定 site_title 與 uwsgi 等變數.</p>
